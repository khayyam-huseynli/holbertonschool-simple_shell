.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command-line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter designed to execute basic commands entered by the user. This shell project is a trimester final project at Holberton
 School, aiming to provide an introduction to shell functionality including command execution, process management, and error handling.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH USAGE
hsh launches the shell interface where users can input commands for execution. Upon execution, simple_shell displays the prompt "#cisfun$" to indicate readiness for command input.
.SH FUNCTIONALITY
hsh provides the following functionality:
.IP "\fB1. Display a prompt\fR"
hsh displays the prompt "Xshell>" (it can be change based on your prompt) and waits for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
.IP "\fB2. Command Execution\fR"
hsh executes the entered command.
.IP "\fB3. Handle Errors\fR"
If an executable cannot be found, hsh prints an error message and displays the prompt again. It also handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
.IP "\fB4. Handle Command Lines with Arguments\fR"
hsh supports command lines with arguments.
.IP "\fB5. Handle PATH\fR"
hsh handles the PATH environment variable to locate executables.
.IP "\fB6. Implement Built-in Commands\fR"
hsh implements the exit and env built-in commands.
.IP "\fB7. Exit Built-in Command\fR"
hsh implements the exit built-in command, which exits the shell.
.IP "\fB8. Usage of exit Command\fR"
Usage: exit. No arguments are passed to the built-in exit command.
.IP "\fB9. Env Built-in Command\fR"
hsh implements the env built-in command, which prints the current environment.
